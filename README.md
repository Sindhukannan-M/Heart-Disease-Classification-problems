# Heart-Disease-Classification-problems
Heart disease prediction using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM. Built in Python with Scikit-learn, Google Collab, and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
**Description:**
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques.
I applied multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the dataset and evaluate model performance.

**Key Highlights:**
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, feature encoding, normalization).

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and feature correlations.

Built and compared multiple classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualized feature importance and model outputs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
